 * @brief Device ray/hit buffer descriptor
 *
 * This structure provides access to device-allocated ray and hit buffers
 * in a backend-agnostic way. The buffers contain XDG's standard ray and hit
 * data structures (dblRay and dblHit), regardless of which compute backend
 * is being used.
 *
 * Key design principle:
 * - Device pointers are opaque (void*)
 * - The data layout is always the XDG types dblRay and dblHit
 * - Downstream code can write to these buffers (hopefully) using any compute API
 *
 * For type-safe access in downstream code:
 * - Cast rayDevPtr to (dblRay*) when using C++ or kernels
 * - Cast hitDevPtr to (dblHit*) when reading hit results
