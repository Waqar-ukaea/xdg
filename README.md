Accelerated Discretized Geometry
--------------------------------

An API for interacting with surface discretizations of CAD geometry for particle transport and method of characteristics applications for solving PDEs.

Currently limited to facet-based geometry composed of triangles.


Benchmarking
------------

XDG is currently being benchmarked against a couple of complex, open source models.

The results of this benchmarking can be found [here](https://pshriwise.github.io/xdg-benchmarking/).
